Alternatively, to modify an existing bot, navigate to your chatbot list and click the 'Create Chatbot' button.

Upon clicking, a dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter a **Chatbot Name** and a **Display Name**.

The **Chatbot Name** is for your reference within your account, helping you identify which chatbot you're working with.
The **Display Name**, visible in the chatbot interface, can be set now or added later. This flexibility allows you to focus on building your
chatbot's core features first and fine-tune its identity as you go.
