**GPT-trainer** allows you to build a chatbot like ChatGPT using your own data and embed it onto your website, 
in minutes, with no coding. You can upload data directly, supply URLs for automated scraping, import data from Google Drive, 
or provide direct text input. You can collect user data with embedded forms and export all conversations for analysis.

In the near future, you will even be able to specify a webhook URL on your own server. 
Our backend would make an API call to your server whenever the end-user asks a triggering question, with the inbound query and session info.
This documentation serves as a guide for accessing your GPT-trainer account using an API. 
To get started with the GPT-trainer API, you will need at least one [API Key](/api-key).

If you already have your API key, great! Let's get started with creating your first [chatbot](/api-usage-example-chatbot).
