**GPT-trainer** is a platform that allows you to create your own **AI assistant**
based on **your own data** without coding. You can embed it on your website for personalized 
assistance and quick query resolution. With a focus on accuracy and privacy, 
GPT-trainer ensures secure data handling and delivers reliable content.

To get started with the **GPT-trainer API**, you'll need **API keys**. 
We recommend you check out this [page](/api-key). where you can find all the necessary information, 
including steps to obtain your API keys.

If you already have your API keys, great! Let's get started with creating your first [chatbot](/api-usage-example-chatbot).
