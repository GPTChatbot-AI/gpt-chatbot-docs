title: Create Your First Chatbot
---

To get started, first log in to your account. If this is your first time using GPT-trainer, you should see this:

Click on **Create new** and enter your desired chatbot name and display name.

</Frame>

The **Chatbot Name** is for your reference within your account, helping you identify which chatbot you're working with.
The **Display Name**, visible in the chatbot interface, can be set now or added later. This flexibility allows you to focus on building your
chatbot's core features first and fine-tune its identity as you go.

Then, head over to **Sources** in the left sidebar:

You can upload unstructured text training data in the form of PDFs, Word, or TXT.
You can also upload simple tables in the form of CSV or Excel. Please note that
GPT-trainer&apos;s ability to handle tables directly is limited.

If you have a website with static content (not rendered by javascript), then you can
specify the URL directly and have our scraper attempt to capture information to use
as training.

After you finish uploading training data, if everything goes well, the **Status**
should show a green light indicating successful training completion.

Next, you can configure the general behavior (including the base prompt) of your chatbot by going into the **Agents** tab.
By default, each chatbot will start with a **General Q&A** Agent. Click it to go into the edit screen:

You may need to scroll down to find the base prompt section. Edit it with explicit instructions
for your chatbot to follow when talking to users.

By default, the **General Q&A** Agent makes use of all your uploaded training sources.
If you&apos;d like to use only a select subset, you can configure it in the **Knowledge** tab.

Once you finish configuring the Agent, click **Save changes**. Then, you can head to the **Settings / Appearance**
tab to edit the appearance and global settings of your chatbot.

If you are satisfied with the setup, you can start testing your chatbot! Go to the **Preview** tab and start a conversation!

When you are ready to deploy it, head to the **Deploy / Integrations** tab.

If you want to share the chatbot as a standalone page, simply click **Share**. You should see a share link automatically generated for you.

If you want to embed the chatbot onto a web page, click **Custom**. Detailed instructions will be displayed on the new right sidebar.

To add more chatbots, simply go to the left sidebar and open the chatbot select dropdown. Click **Create Chatbot**.

  to the number of chatbots you can create.
