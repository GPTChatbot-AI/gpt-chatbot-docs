The Security section of your chatbot's settings is designed to enhance the bot's security and control. Here’s a breakdown of the subsections and their functionalities:

1. **Visibility Settings:**

   - **Private:** These are exclusive to your account and are not accessible to anyone else. Ideal for internal use or when you want to restrict access.
   - **Public:** Accessible to anyone with the link on gpt-trainer.com and can be embedded on your website.
     This setting is suitable for chatbots intended for wide public interaction.
   - **Hybrid:** These can be embedded on your website, but link sharing is not allowed.
     This option offers a balance between public access and controlled distribution.

2. **Domains:**

   - **Domain Restriction:** Here, you can specify the domains where your chatbot is allowed to operate. By listing domains,
     you ensure that the chatbot is only embedded and active on designated websites.
   - **Allow All Domains:** By choosing this option, your chatbot can be embedded and used on any website without restrictions.
     This setting is useful for chatbots meant for broad reach and accessibility.

3. **Rate Limit:**

   - **Limiting Messages:** This functionality allows you to set a cap on the number of messages that can be sent from one device within a specific timeframe.
     This is particularly important for iframe and chat bubble implementations to prevent abuse.
   - **Customization Options:** You can customize the limit, such as setting it to '20 messages every 240 seconds'.
     This ensures users have a fair usage policy while interacting with your chatbot.
   - **Limit Reached Message:** When a user hits the rate limit, the chatbot will display a predefined message, like "Too many messages in a row."
     This informs users that they’ve reached the message limit and need to wait before sending more messages.

## Prompt

The Prompt section is integral for guiding the AI to generate intelligent and contextually relevant responses.
Here's an overview of the options and functionalities available in this section:

1. **Model Selection:**

   - **GPT-3.5:** This model is an excellent choice for general use, offering a balance between speed and quality of output.
     It consumes 1 message credit per message, making it cost-effective for most applications.
   - **GPT-3.5-16k:** For more extensive document context processing, GPT-3.5-turbo-16k is available at 8 credits per message.
     It can process four times more context than the standard version, leading to improved output generation.
   - **GPT-4:** Known for its superior reasoning and accuracy, GPT-4 is the most advanced option.
     It's slower and costs 20 credits per message, but it excels in delivering highly sophisticated responses.

<Note>
  The choice of model will affect the AI's understanding and response
  capability. The character limit for prompts might vary depending on the
  selected model, which is important to consider when designing interactions.
</Note>

2. **Base Prompt:**

   - **Guiding the AI:** The base prompt acts as initial guidance for the AI. It sets the context and tone for how the chatbot should understand queries and
     formulate responses. A well-crafted base prompt ensures that the conversation flow remains relevant and coherent.
   - **Customizing Responses:** By tailoring the base prompt, you can influence the chatbot's style of communication. Whether you want it to be formal,
     casual, informative, or supportive, the base prompt is where you embed these characteristics.
   - **Consistency in Conversation:** The base prompt helps maintain consistency in the chatbot's responses, ensuring that each reply aligns with the overall purpose
     and personality of the chatbot.
   - **Character Limit Considerations:** It's important to note that the character limit for the base prompt may vary depending on the chosen AI model.
     This limitation should be kept in mind when designing the base prompt, especially when using more advanced models like GPT-4,
     which might have different constraints compared to GPT-3.5.
   - **Strategic Use:** The base prompt should be strategically developed to maximize the effectiveness of the AI. It should be concise yet
     comprehensive enough to cover the scope of expected interactions.

<Note>
  **Base Prompt** section is essential for laying the groundwork for your
  chatbot’s interactions. A well-thought-out base prompt not only enhances the
  quality of the AI’s responses but also ensures that the chatbot remains

  choose to close it; otherwise, it will reappear after each message.
</Note>

2. **Q&A Settings Before Form Display:**

   - **Control Form Timing:** Set the number of messages after which the form appears. Setting it to 0 means the form will appear right away,
     allowing you to gather user information at the beginning of the conversation.

3. **Success Message Post-Form Completion:**

   - **User Feedback:** Customize a success message that will display to users after they complete the form.
     This provides positive reinforcement and clarity that their information has been successfully submitted.

   - **Data Integration:** Once a user submits the form, the data is recorded in the Conversation history. This information can be reused based on your
     requirements, such as for personalized responses or follow-up communications.

<Note>
  The form is designed to appear only once per session to prevent annoyance.
  This means if a user has already submitted or ignored the form in a previous
  conversation, it won’t repeatedly appear in subsequent interactions within the
  same session. This approach is mindful of user experience, ensuring they are
  not overwhelmed or frustrated by repetitive form prompts.
