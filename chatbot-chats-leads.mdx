1. **Comprehensive Conversation Tracking:** Monitor every conversation that occurs within your chatbot. This includes an overview of what users are asking, giving you valuable
   insights into their needs and queries.
2. **Detailed Chat History:** Access the entire history of conversations. This section allows for robust filtering options, such as sorting by date, time, and various aspects like whether
   the chatbot was accessed via a link, embedded on a site, or used through an API or other integrations.
3. **User Information Display:** For each conversation, if the user has provided their details through a [form](../chatbot-settings#leads-form), this information will be displayed. This feature is crucial
   for personalizing follow-ups and understanding your user base better.
4. **Conversation Management Tools:** You have the flexibility to export conversations for further analysis or record-keeping. Additionally, there is an option to delete
   conversations entirely, giving you control over the data management and privacy aspects of your chatbot interactions.

In addition to monitoring chats, the Leads section is specifically designed to manage and utilize the information users leave through [forms](../chatbot-settings#leads-form) in your chatbot.
This section is vital for engaging with your audience on a more personal level and enhancing their experience with your service or product.

1. **Lead Information Access:** When users submit their details through a form integrated into your chatbot, this information is stored and made accessible in the
   Leads section. This can include contact details, specific inquiries, preferences, or any other data collected through the form.
2. **User Engagement:** Utilize the collected information to provide personalized feedback, support, or marketing content to your users. This targeted approach
   can significantly enhance user engagement and satisfaction, as you can address their specific needs or queries more effectively.
3. **Data Management for Leads:** Similar to the Chats section, you have the capability to manage this data efficiently. This includes sorting,
   analyzing, and exporting the lead information for further use in your customer relationship management, marketing strategies, or personalized follow-ups.
